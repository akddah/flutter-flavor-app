  <h1>Flutter App with Flavors</h1>
  
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    This is a Flutter application that supports both Android and iOS platforms. The app incorporates the concept of flavors to create different versions of the app with individual configurations, such as connecting to separate Firebase projects, customizing application icons, and assigning unique names for each flavor on Android and iOS.
  </p>
  
  <h2>What is Flutter Flavor?</h2>
  <p>
    Flutter Flavor is a technique that allows developers to create multiple variants of a Flutter app, each with its own set of configurations. With flavors, you can easily build and maintain different versions of your app, tailored for specific environments or requirements. Flavors enable you to have distinct Firebase configurations, application icons, names, and other settings for each variant.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Benefits of Using Flavors</h2>
  <p>By leveraging flavors in your Flutter app, you can:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Connect more than one Firebase project to each flavor individually. This allows you to have separate backend configurations, databases, and services for each variant, ensuring isolation and flexibility.</li>
    <li>Customize the application icon for each flavor on Android and iOS. This allows you to provide a unique visual identity to each variant, making them easily distinguishable.</li>
    <li>Assign a pure name for each flavor on Android and iOS. This enables you to give a distinct and meaningful name to each variant, enhancing the user experience and branding.</li>
    <li>Efficiently manage and maintain multiple versions of your app. With flavors, you can easily switch between different configurations during development and deployment, streamlining the process and reducing potential errors.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Getting Started</h2>
  <p>
    To start using flavors in your Flutter app, follow the steps below:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Clone the repository to your local machine.</li>
    <li>Install Flutter SDK by following the official Flutter installation guide.</li>
    <li>Configure your Firebase projects for each flavor, ensuring that you have separate project configurations and necessary files (such as <code>google-services.json</code> for Android and <code>GoogleService-Info.plist</code> for iOS) for each flavor.</li>
    <li>Customize the application icons for each flavor on Android and iOS by replacing the default icons with your own.</li>
    <li>Assign a pure name for each flavor on Android and iOS by updating the corresponding configuration files.</li>
  </ol>
